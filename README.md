# fingerprint-sensor-uniqueID
C++ source code for getting unique ID or finger template using IoT fingerprint sensor

FIRST THING YOU NEED TO DO IS STORING YOUR FINGER ID USING LIBRARY EXAMPLE. WITHOUT IT, YOU MAY NOT BE ABLE TO GET YOUR FINGER TEMPLATE OR UNIQUE ID.
USE ARDUINO UNO WITH WIFI OR ESP32 (WIFI BUILT IN) INSTEAD!!!
